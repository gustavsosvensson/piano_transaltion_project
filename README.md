This is more or less a compilation of different applications, combined and compiled into a single project for the specific usage of converting PDfs into MIDIs and displaying said MIDIs. The project borrows a lot of code from other publicly available repositaries, specifically: Musescore 4, Ideal Piano and Audiveris, I appriciate them all very much, check them out if you can, I couldn't have done this wihout them

Musescore 4: https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore?tab=License-1-ov-file*  
Audiveris: https://github.com/Audiveris/audiveris  
Ideal-piano: https://github.com/Rainbow-Dreamer/Ideal-Piano  


The project is an assignment and the development/process can be viewed in the provided presentation.
